# Suppliers

<span style="color: red">**Note:**</span> _Please note that the currently supported WLAN Pi platform, the NEO2, is no longer available from the hardware manufacturer. As a result, no new hardware will be available to purchase from the manufacturer going forwards. Our kit suppliers listed below may occasionally find surplus stocks from various resellers and make them available, but numbers are generally very limited. Please check the kit suppliers shown below for availability._

_A new hardware platform is under development to replace the NEO2, but there are currently no fixed timescales for its availability. Please [check here][availability] for our latest statement on platform availability_
