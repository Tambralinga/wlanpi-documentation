# Getting Involved - I'm Not a Coder!

The WLANPi project is a community effort and we welcome volunteers to contribute to our efforts. 

Most folks who join the project are interested in the "cool" coding part of the project. But, the truth is that without rigorous testing and good quality documentation, the quality of the delivered project is likely to be compromised.

Even if you are not a coder, but would still like to be involved with the project, we need people like you to test code and ensure that documentation is up to scratch. Every time that code is updated, things will break - carefully testing the code is a critical activity before we release it out to the user base. Each time we release a new image version, we catch many unexpected bugs due to beta testing. This requires significant effort and we really need more help with writing test plans and executing test suites.

Once we have new code ready to go, we also need to make sure it is sufficiently documented so that our user base are able to use it. Again, coding is the "sexy" part of the project that many tend to focus on. But, if people don't know how to use the code, the developers have wasted their time. We need people to help to create, edit and maintain the documentation that ensures users can use the full suite of WLAN Pi features.

If you'd like to be involved in any of these areas, please contact [Jerry Olla][jerry_twitter] or [Nigel Bowden][nigel_twitter] on Twitter or track them down via any well known search engine.
