# Getting Involved - Feature Requests

Once you've been using the WLAN Pi for a while, you'll probably start to think: *"wouldn't it be great if the WLAN Pi could do xyz?"*, or: *"wouldn't it be great if package x were available on the WLAN Pi?"*

If you have any suggestions that you think are worthy of consideration, then please open a feature request on GitHub. It will be considered for addition to our roadmap. If you're have some coding skills, it may even be worth offering to code it yourself and maybe pull together some proof of concept code.

If you submit a suggestion, please remember that we are a group of volunteers doing this work in our spare time, so it may take some time for us to get back to you.

To submit a feature request/suggestion, submit a request via the GitHub issues feature (note that this will require you to create a (free) GitHub account). If you visit the following page, you will be able to open a new request:

[https://github.com/WLAN-Pi/wlanpi/issues](https://github.com/WLAN-Pi/wlanpi/issues)

If you hit the "New Issue" button, you will be presented with a form where you can enter the feature request details. Please provide as much information as possible about your idea/request. Links to web sites of existing linux or similar packages (if applicable), screen shots and sample code will all help if available.

Also, if possible, mark the request as a enhancement using the label drop-down on the right of the web form.
<div style="float: center;">

</div>

Once you have submitted the request, an email alert will be generated to a team of people and it will be forwarded on to the relevant person by one of the team that picks it up. Please be patient when waiting for a response, as we are all volunteers doing this in our spare time.
